AnimatsChess is a simple chess playing program with a 
variety of user interfaces.

To run the program you will require Java Runtime installed.

Once this is installed, change to the 'bin' directory and
type 'java -jar AnimatsChess.jar swing' to run the GUI 
interface. Other command-line options include 'console' 
(the default) and 'xboard'.

To recompile type 'ant' from the root of the distribution.
